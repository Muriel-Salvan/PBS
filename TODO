**** Optionally remember plugins that we want to ignore always (if not installed), and set a way in options to remove them from the forget list.

** Plugins
*** Create Windows/KDE programs shortcuts in start menu part of the additional plugin commands (this way, it is still possible to do it after a move of the program location)
*** Plugin for Opera
*** Create a tool that checks validity of Shortcuts (file exists or URL ok...)
*** Files Export plugin should create Windows Shortcuts for Shell types as well.
*** Plugin for Safari
*** Export plugins should log success or failure
*** When never saved, command Save should trigger SaveAs.
*** Give plugins mechanism for additional tools (commands)
*** XML export plugin: format output to be easily editable by hand
*** Should run non-executable commands with the associated program (use start)
*** Make a command that creates all relevant links to a SF.net project
*** Create a plugin that scans Shortcuts for redirections and update them (see the accessFile code for handling redirections, and also handle <meta http-equiv="Refresh"> Tag if the user wants it)

*** Create an integration plugin that execute some Shortcuts at startup time

* Increase performances:

* Bug correction: disable shortcuts while editing label in TreeCtrl.
* Make integration plugin that puts itself as a FireFox plugin.
