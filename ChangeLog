= PBS Release History

== 0.0.5.20090810 (Alpha)

=== Important notice ===

This release breaks some compatibility with previous ones:
* Options files (*.pbso) are not compatible anymore with previous versions. If you have already installed and used a previous version of PBS, please delete the Options.pbso file at your PBS directory before running PBS 0.0.5.

=== Shortcut commands ===

* Implemented plugin mechanism for shortcuts commands.
* Some plugin commands should be applicable to only some shortcut types.

=== Plugins ===

* Implemented shortcut command plugin that finds icons based on files, favicons...
* Relative paths of favicons are from the URL current directory, not from the root
* Find along PATH to get commands that are not specified with their path for icons research of type Shell
* HTML import plugin: added some missing HTML tags
* Tray: Set the Tray icon hint text to the integrated Tag name
* Tray: Adding option of size of icons in menu (different sizes for items in first menu than in consecutive ones)

=== Linux ===

* Changed big Ruby cases (more than 490 'when' clauses) that prevented Ruby on Linux to parse source code (yacc stack overflow error).
* Failed attempt to run PBS on Linux Fedora 11 (Couldn't make wxRuby work on Linux, and couldn't compile wxGTK-gl either). Will retry later.

=== Other ===

* Generic mechanism to gather all errors (logErr) that occur during an operation, and display them at the end of each operation.
* Valid file names are now platform specifics
* Transactions can be cascaded without errors.
* accessFile can handle URL redirections and cycles.
* Added some more log debugs that can be useful when dealing with URLs.
* Changed logBug error while loading an icon into logErr as user can select invalid files.
* Added a way to get the default icon from a given content (favicon, program icon...)

=== Bug corrections ===

* Bug correction (#2818896): Error message when Windows exits

== 0.0.4.20090717 (Alpha)

=== Important notice ===

This release breaks some compatibility with previous ones:
* Previous .pbss and .pbso files will not be read correctly (be careful, as they will be read, but will corrupt data). You need to first export your data in XML format using your current PBS version, then update PBS and import your XML file. Read carefully next point if you have some Shell Shortcuts in your data to be migrated.
* Previously exported XML files containing at least 1 Shell Shortcut (URL Shortcuts are fine) will fail to be imported. If you need to import such an XML file, please first uncomment (remove leading #) lines 141-155 in lib/Plugins/Types/Shell.rb file, restart PBS and import your XML files previously exported by PBS v <= 0.0.3. Once this migration has been done, please re-comment lines of Shell.rb in order to be able to read newly exported XML files. Sorry about the inconvenience.

So, to sum up: don't load previously saved .pbss and .pbso files, as there is a compatibility break in the file format in 0.0.4
If you still want to retrieve your previously loaded data, here are the steps to perform BEFORE installing 0.0.4:
1. Run previous PBS version
2. Export your Shortcuts in an XML file
3. Install new 0.0.4 version
4. IF you have some Shell Shortcuts (not Internet bookmarks) that have been exported in the XML file:
   Edit file lib/Plugins/Types/Shell.rb and uncomment lines 141-155.
5. Run new PBS 0.0.4 version
6. Import your XML file
7. You can now save it in a .pbss file that you can reopen without corrupting any data
8. IF you have uncommented lines at step 4., re-comment them (otherwise you will not be able to read XML files that will be exported with version 0.0.4), and restart PBS for changes to be taken into account.

=== Bugs correction ===

* Bug correction: Open a file deleting previous data generates error messages about non protected operations.

** !!! This bug correction breaks compatibility with previous XML format. If you want to import an XML file exported by PBS versions (0.0.1 - 0.0.3) that contain Shell Shortcuts (others are ok), please first uncomment (remove leading #) lines 141-155 in lib/Plugins/Types/Shell.rb file, restart PBS and import your XML files previously exported by PBS v <= 0.0.3. Once this migration has been done, please re-comment lines of Shell.rb in order to be able to read newly exported XML files.
* Bug correction: Add new integration plugin generated an error message.
