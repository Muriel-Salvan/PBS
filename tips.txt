Welcome to PBS: Portable Bookmarks and Shortcuts. You can find any documentation on http://pbstool.sourceforge.net
A Shortcut is a simple item referencing some content (internet address, shell command...).
A Tag is a label. You can use them to categorize your Shortcuts. A Shortcut can be associated to several Tags at once.
PBS integrates in many places of your system to give you fast and easy access to your Shortcuts. You can change these settings in "Tools/Setup/Integration plugins".
You can drag and drop content from several running PBS applications. Start dragging from the main tree.
You can copy/paste/cut content from several running PBS applications. Start in the main tree.
There is a handy contextual menu: try right-clicking on a Shortcut or a Tag from the main tree.
The root Tag in the main tree can be used to drop or paste content. Selecting the root Tag selects all Tags and Shortcuts.
Everything in PBS is undoable, even opening a new file, overwriting existing work.
It is very easy to contribute to PBS by writing plugins for importing/exporting, for integrating PBS in other places, for creating new Shortcuts types. Check the documentation on http://pbstool.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/PBS_internal_architecture
